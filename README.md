The *core folder* contains all of the source code used in the train simulation and the *desktop project folder* contains the desktop application that renders the simulation.

Implementation Checklist:

1. ~~**State Machine Diagram** for the existing Train class~~
2. ~~**Report** of the inadequacies of the current design (1200 - 1500 words)~~
3. **Class Diagram** reflecting and correcting the flaws of the old model
4. **Sequence Diagram** reflecting the Train simulation
5. **Implementation** on top of the source code


A lot of the implementation of the suggested design does not need to be reflected entirely on the implementation step. Such examples are going to the be the protected variation suggested changes. Due to the constraint of time, the scope of the final design might need to be re-evaluated and some parts cut out if be necessary.
